=== 1.3.12

=== 1.3.11

* Support Ruby 2.2-2.7
* Add ruby2_keywords.rb to ignored modules
* Update lzma.exe to version 19.00
* Workaround for warning about deprecated Object#=~
* Use Fiddle instead of Win32API
* Fix for invalid argument to relative_path_from

=== 1.3.10

* Reduce memory usage while building & compressing (avoids out of
  memory issue on really big programs).

* Compile stub.exe with 32-bit compiler again

=== 1.3.9

* Support Ruby 2.4.1p111 (include manifest)

=== 1.3.8

* Use GetModuleFileNameW for DLL detection

=== 1.3.7

* Workaround for handling of file names and directory name with
  non-ASCII characters (e.g. "invalid byte sequence in UTF-8")

=== 1.3.6

* More robust cleanup of temporary files. Deletes using manual
  recursive method instead of using the shell. Will mark files for
  later deletion both using Windows (requires Administrator
  privileges) and a custom method that will remove old temporary files
  when the executable is restarted.

=== 1.3.5

* Fixes for Ruby 2.2.2p95

=== 1.3.4

* Workarounds for Ruby 2.1.5

=== 1.3.3

* Rebuild executables with MinGW GCC 4.8.1-4.

=== 1.3.2

* Refactored Gemfile handling for better compatibility with Ruby
  version.

=== 1.3.1

* Now includes $LOADED_FEATURES even when script is not run to check
  dependencies. This fixes compatability with Ruby 1.9.3 where
  rubygems is always loaded.

* Fixed compatability with Ruby 2.0.0: Temp-path alias in binary
  changed to be valid UTF-8 character.

* README.txt updated related to --no-dep-run (karhatsu).

* Fixes for Bundler handling (DavidMikeSimon).

=== 1.3.0

* Fixed some additional corner cases with absolute and relative
  require & load paths. Extended test suite to cover a lot more
  cases.

* Now provides a meaningful exit status code (1 on error, 0 on
  success). (DavidMikeSimon)

* New option to _not_ run the script to detect dependencies
  (--no-dep-run). (DavidMikeSimon)

* Bundler support using the --gemfile option. (DavidMikeSimon)

* Debug mode support in the stub (--debug). Also --debug-extract to
  keep extracted files from executable. (DavidMikeSimon)

* New gem behaviour yet again due to changes in Rubygems. See README
  file.

=== 1.2.0

* Ignore console events (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Break). Ruby process handles
  them anyway and exist, allowing the stub to clean up temporary
  files.

* Temporary memory used for decompression is now freed before the ruby
  interpreter is launched by the stub.

* Progress dialog is no longer displayed when removing temporary
  files.

* Now includes most files from any require'd Rubygem (Now works with
  mime-types, oledb and other gems that load additional data files
  from the Gem installation). Some files are still ignored
  (e.g. Readme's). Use "--no-gem-filter" to make Ocra unconditionally
  include all files listed in the Gem specification (Thanks to Jorge
  L. Cangas for patch & ideas).

* NameErrors are now rescued when attempting to load autoloadable
  constants. Hopefully resolves issues with ActiveRecord [#28488].

* Now works if the script changes environment or working directory
  while running.

* Fixed a regression in 1.1.4 when resource files are specified;
  directory layout would not be maintained, e.g. when running "ocra
  bin/script share/data.dat".

* Added support for passing arguments to script. Specify argument to
  your script after a "--" marker. Arguments will be passed both at
  compile time and run time. (#27815)

* Now works if the source files are located beneath Ruby's
  exec_prefix. (#28505)

=== 1.1.4

* The tempdir marker is now pretty-printed as "<tempdir>" in the
  output.

* Fixed various issues with path and filenames being handled case
  sensitive.

* Now uses config settings for Ruby executable names (should now also
  work with ruby installations built with --program-suffix).

* Supported invoking ocra with an absolute path to the script. Will
  assume that the script is in the root of the source hierachy.

=== 1.1.3

* Use Win32API (provided with Ruby) instead of win32-api (gem).

* No longer sets GEM_HOME (which would override the default gem
  path). Instead sets GEM_PATH. Resolves issues with gems not loading
  on Ruby 1.9.

=== 1.1.2

* Warnings can be disabled using --no-warnings.

* Fixed not .exe being generated when script calls 'exit'.

* Path to the generated executable is now avilable to the running
  script in the OCRA_EXECUTABLE environment variable.

* Directories on the command line will now be created.

* Supports path globs, fx. "ocra script.rb assets/**/*.png". (See
  documentation for Ruby's Dir class).

* Fixed issue with spaces in temporary path (TMP environment).

* Improved path comparison to ignore case (this is Windows after all)
  and be a bit more robust.

* Added support for RubyGems installed in GEM_HOME (or other part
  handled by RubyGems). If not installed in the Ruby hierarchy, they
  will now be installed in a directory named 'gemhome' under the
  temporary directory.

=== 1.1.1

* Fixed duplicate entries in the RUBYLIB environment variable.

* Another slight fix for relative load paths.

* RUBYOPT is now set to the value it had when OCRA was invoked.

=== 1.1.0

* Added an icon to the executable. Can be replaced from a .ico file
  using the --icon <ico> option.

* Improved handling of load paths added either from the command line
  (ruby -I), RUBYLIB environment variable or during the script (by
  modifying $: or $LOAD_PATH).

* Now automatically detects loaded DLLs through Win32::API. Disable
  with --no-autodll.

=== 1.0.3 / 2009-05-25

* Fixed invokation of executables with spaces in path names (#25966).

* Fixed inverted handling of --windows & --console (#25974)

* Fixed installation issue with RubyGems (missing "lib")

=== 1.0.2 / 2009-05-10

* Added stubw.exe to gem (was missing 1.0.1)

=== 1.0.1 / 2009-05-05

* Added stub with windows runtime for windowed applications
  (e.g. wxRuby) and fixed issue where OCRA would use ruby.exe instead
  of rubyw.exe for such programs. [#25774]

=== 1.0.0 / 2009-04-05

* 1 major enhancement

  * Birthday!
